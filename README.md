## About

This project a part of my **bachelorâ€™s thesis**, where we developed **SkinMap**, a weighted full-body skin segmentation model designed to improve the robustness of remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) under challenging scenarios such as head movement, talking, and varying lighting conditions.
